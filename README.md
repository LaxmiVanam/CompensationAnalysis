• train_features.csv: Each row represents metadata for an individual job posting.
The “jobId” column represents a unique identifier for the job posting. The remaining columns describe features of the job posting.
• train_salaries.csv: Each row associates a “jobId” with a “salary”.
• test_features.csv: Similar to train_features.csv, each row represents metadata for an individual job posting.
